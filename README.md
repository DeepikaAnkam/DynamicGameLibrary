# DynamicGameLibrary
Developed a dynamic web application with CRUD operations for a 'games' database using MongoDB. The project featured advanced search, filtering, and both Single Page Application and server-side rendering techniques. I focused on robust error handling and enhancing user interaction, demonstrating versatile full-stack development skills.
